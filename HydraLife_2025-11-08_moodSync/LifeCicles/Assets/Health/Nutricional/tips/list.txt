TipDescription
To eat more whole grains, substitute a whole-grain product for a refined product – such as eating whole-wheat bread instead of white bread or brown rice instead of white rice. It’s important to substitute the whole-grain product for the refined one, rather than adding the whole-grain product. 
For a change, try brown rice or whole-wheat pasta. Try brown rice stuffing in baked green peppers or tomatoes and whole-wheat macaroni in macaroni and cheese. 
Use whole grains in mixed dishes, such as barley in vegetable soup or stews and bulgur wheat in casserole or stir-fries. 
Create a whole grain pilaf with a mixture of barley, wild rice, brown rice, broth and spices. For a special touch, stir in toasted nuts or chopped dried fruit. 
Experiment by substituting whole wheat or oat flour for up to half of the flour in pancake, waffle, muffin or other flour-based recipes. They may need a bit more leavening. 
Use whole-grain bread or cracker crumbs in meatloaf. 
Try rolled oats or a crushed, unsweetened whole grain cereal as breading for baked chicken, fish, veal cutlets, or eggplant parmesan. 
Try an unsweetened, whole grain ready-to-eat cereal as croutons in salad or in place of crackers with soup. 
Freeze leftover cooked brown rice, bulgur, or barley. Heat and serve it later as a quick side dish. 
Snack on ready-to-eat, whole grain cereals such as toasted oat cereal. 
Add whole-grain flour or oatmeal when making cookies or other baked treats. 
Try a whole-grain snack chip, such as baked tortilla chips. 
Popcorn, a whole grain, can be a healthy snack with little or no added salt and butter. 
"Choose foods that name one of the following whole-grain ingredients first on the label’s ingredient list:
 
“b
rown rice”
“bulgur”
“graham flour”
“oatmeal”
“whole-grain corn”
 
 "
Foods labeled with the words “multi-grain,” “stone-ground,” “100% wheat,” “cracked wheat,” “seven-grain,” or “bran” are usually not whole-grain products. 
Color is not an indication of a whole grain. Bread can be brown because of molasses or other added ingredients. Read the ingredient list to see if it is a whole grain. 
Use the Nutrition Facts label and choose products with a higher % Daily Value (%DV) for fiber – the %DV for fiber is a good clue to the amount of whole grain in the product. 
Read the food label’s ingredient list. Look for terms that indicate added sugars (sucrose, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, and molasses) and oils (partially hydrogenated vegetable oils) that add extra calories. Choose foods with fewer added sugars, fats, or oils. 
Most sodium in the food supply comes from packaged foods. Similar packaged foods can vary widely in sodium content, including breads. Use the Nutrition Facts label to choose foods with a lower % DV for sodium. Foods with less than 140 mg sodium per serving can be labeled as low sodium foods. Claims such as “low in sodium” or “very low in sodium” on the front of the food label can help you identify foods that contain less salt (or sodium).
Set a good example for children by eating whole grains with meals or as snacks. 
Let children select and help prepare a whole grain side dish. 
Teach older children to read the ingredient list on cereals or snack food packages and choose those with whole grains at the top of the list. 
Buy fresh vegetables in season. They cost less and are likely to be at their peak flavor. 
Stock up on frozen vegetables for quick and easy cooking in the microwave. 
Buy vegetables that are easy to prepare. Pick up pre-washed bags of salad greens and add baby carrots or grape tomatoes for a salad in minutes. Buy packages of such as baby carrots or celery sticks for quick snacks. 
Use a microwave to quickly “zap” vegetables. White or sweet potatoes can be baked quickly this way. 
Vary your veggie choices to keep meals interesting. 
Try crunchy vegetables, raw or lightly steamed. 
Select vegetables with more potassium often, such as sweetpotatoes, white potatoes, white beans, tomato products (paste, sauce, and juice), beet greens, soybeans, lima beans, winter squash, spinach, lentils, kidney beans, and split peas.
Sauces or seasonings can add calories, fat, and sodium to vegetables. Use the Nutrition Facts label to compare the calories and % Daily Value for fat and sodium in plain and seasoned vegetables. 
Prepare more foods from fresh ingredients to lower sodium intake. Most sodium in the food supply comes from packaged or processed foods. 
Buy canned vegetables labeled “no salt added.” If you want to add a little salt it will likely be less than the amount in the regular canned product. 
Plan some meals around a vegetable main dish, such as a vegetable stir-fry or soup. Then add other foods to complement it.

Cut-up fruit makes a great snack. Either cut them yourself, or buy pre-cut packages of fruit pieces like pineapples or melons. Or, try whole fresh berries or grapes. 
Dried fruits also make a great snack. They are easy to carry and store well. Because they are dried, ¼ cup is equivalent to ½ cup of other fruits. 
Keep a package of dried fruit in your desk or bag. Some fruits that are available dried include apricots, apples, pineapple, bananas, cherries, figs, dates, cranberries, blueberries, prunes (dried plums), and raisins (dried grapes).
